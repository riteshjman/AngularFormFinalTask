## Core Layer Checklist

- Source name shouldn't be present in the table or column name
- Identify the PK Id for the table
- Validate the revenue numbers against the prep layer tables
- Core tables:
  - Verify the columns required for the reporting
  - Use join and bring the necessary columns and calculated columns
    - Check the count of rows before and after the join
  - If we are combining the tables, need to verify the count
